The files located in this folder are mainly used to organise some of my ideas and jot them down.
Eventually these should be moved to their own repository which displays these on a web page.

For now however, these are in this repository for convenience (and because I'm a bit lazy).
Speaking of laziness, I should check their grammar and spelling at some point, many were hastily written so 
are not quite up to snuff, or not as concise as they should be. Some examples don't make much sense, and the depth
with which subjects are covered varies wildly.
