# General inspirations of the language

The following is a list of programming languages that inspired this one in one way or another. This can either be
certain constructs or keywords in the language, or the philosophy of the language as a whole.

Language  | Description | Inspired
----------|-------------|------------
Python    |  | Flexibility. Co-existence of functions and methods, or co-existence of functional and oop paradigms. Large portion of the syntax.
Java      |  | OOP concepts. Strict typing rules.
C#        |  | OOP concepts.
Scala     |  | Everything is an object, including primitives of the language, pattern matching.
Kotlin    |  | Ranges. Type aliases, relying in keywords to define common use cases instead of having to write everything out explicitly.
Ada       |  | Custom data types (or type aliases) with ranges. Inspired use of type refinement. Strict typing rules. Natural language over symbols, such using `and` stead of `&&`.
C++       |  | OOP concept.
C         |  | General programming concepts, not so much a direct inspiration but a general influence.
Eiffel    |  | Design by contract philosophy, the `retry` keyword. Design by contract inspired used of type refinement. 
Haskell   |  | Pattern Matching. Lack of mutability. Closeness of mapping with mathematical notation, for instance set constructor notation.
Rust      |  | Error handling mechanisms. Strict rules regarding mutability.
Ruby      |  | Syntax sugar, postfix `if` operator. Philosophy that flexibility is not inherently a bad thing.
Swift     |  | Error handling mechanisms.
Go        |  | Error handling mechanisms, encouraging error handling on site.
MATLAB    |  | Concepts of flexibility, certain syntax.
SmallTalk |  | OOP concepts, emphasis on program state.
JavaScript |  | Interchangeability of variables and functions. Flexibility.
COBOL |  | Use of natural language for clarity. Not to the same extent however. 
Perl |  | The `forward` keyword.
