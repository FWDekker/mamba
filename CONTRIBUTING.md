# üë• Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are encouraged!

A good place to start is by looking at [good first issues](https://github.com/JSAbrahams/mamba/labels/good%20first%20issue).

Please read our [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## üìù Procedures

We standardise the process of creating issues and pull requests to make it easier to manage the project.
Please adhere to these standards.

*Note* In general, it is better to only comment on open pull requests and issues.
Comments on closed issues and pull requests are likely to be ignored.

### ‚ùó Submitting an Issue

-   Do use one of the provided templates if possible.
-   Do check if there are already similar issues or pull requests before submitting a new issue.
-   Do add an issue to the relevant project if applicable.
-   Do assign the relevant milestone to an issue if applicable.
-   Do reference other issues if applicable.

### ‚ùì Submitting a Pull Request

-   Do use the provided template.
-   Do check that there are no other pull requests that are doing the same thing. 
    -   If you think your solution is better than an existing pull request, it is better to comment there first and engage in discussion before opening your own pull request.
-   Do reference other issues and pull requests that are relevant
-   Do actively engage with the comments on the pull request. 
    -   An active discussion might lead to an even better solution or new ideas!
-   Do make sure the build passes, ideally by running `rustfmt` and `clippy` locally before pushing.
-   Do add tests when fixing a bug or adding new functionality.
-   Do make sure that this PR is targets one single issue, as large pull requests are difficult to review and unlikely to get merged
-   Do make sure that the base branch is the correct branch by observing the Git branching model.

### Git Branching Model

For all the below, every merge is preceded by a Pull Request.

-   New featuers branch off and are merged with the development branch.
-   Large features get their own branch, and sub-features branch from this branch and are merged with this branch, before the feature branch is merged with develop.
-   Once develop has amassed enough features for a new release, we new branch is created where a release is staged (e.g. `v0.3.1`).
-   Once approved, the new feature branch is merged with master.
-   The new merged release is tagged, and a new release is published on GitHub and published to [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/mamba).

## üîÑ Continuous Integration Tools

We use continuous integration tools to help ensure that no regression takes place.
Therefore, when adding new functionality or fixing a bug, tests are greatly appreciated.

Please read the tooling section in the [README](/README.md) to get more information on how to set up tooling locally, which are used by the CI tools.
A pull request will only be merged if the builds pass.

The CI Tools use:
-   `cargo test` to check that all tests pass.
-   `cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check` to check that there are no formatting errors.
-   `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to use a collection of lints to check for common Rust mistakes.
